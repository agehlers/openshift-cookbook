If you are using OpenShift Online Starter you cannot use a custom domain name when creating a route for an application. A custom domain name is only supported with OpenShift Online Pro.

For further information on the differences between OpenShift Online Starter and Pro
environments see the [plans and pricing](https://www.openshift.com/pricing/index.html) page for OpenShift Online.
