To learn more about OpenShift without needing to install it yourself you can use the [interactive learning portal](https://learn.openshift.com) for OpenShift. This provides a set of guided exercises that you can work through to learn about using OpenShift to deploy applications.

To try out OpenShift running on the leading cloud providers you can use the [test drive lab](https://www.openshift.com/dedicated/test-drive.html) environments. These environments allow you to test deploying your own applications, or experiment with administering an OpenShift cluster.
