If you want to install and run OpenShift yourself, you can install [OpenShift Origin](https://www.openshift.org). The recommended installation method for OpenShift Origin uses a set of Ansible playbooks. Provide details about your environment and the machine nodes you have available, run Ansible, and the cluster will be set up for you. You can find instructions in the [advanced installation](https://docs.openshift.org/latest/install_config/install/advanced_install.html) documentation on the OpenShift Origin web site.

OpenShift Origin is a community supported distribution of OpenShift. If you would prefer to run your own OpenShift cluster, but have access to professional support services, you can obtain a subscription for [OpenShift Container Platform](https://www.openshift.com/container-platform/) from Red Hat.
